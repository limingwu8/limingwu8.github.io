I am currently a software engineer at Google, Inc. I joined the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at Purdue University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2019. I worked as a research assistant at the [Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/) advised by Professor [Edward. J. Delp](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/). My research focuses on three-dimensional fluorescence [microscopy image analysis](http://www.microscopy-purdue.net), and I am particularly interested in computer vision and deep learning algorithms.

Before that I obtained my M.S. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue University Northwest](https://www.pnw.edu) in May 2019.
