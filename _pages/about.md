I joined the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at Purdue University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2019. I work as a research assistant at the [Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/) advised by Professor [Edward J. Delp](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/). Before that I obtained my MS degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University Northwest in 2019. My research focuses on three-dimensional fluorescence [microscopy image analysis](http://www.microscopy-purdue.net), and I am particularly interested in computer vision and deep learning algorithms.
