I joined the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2019. I work as a research assistant at the Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER) advised by Prof. Edward J. Delp. Before that I obtained my MS degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University Northwest in 2019. My research focuses on three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy image analysis, and I am particularly interested in computer vision and deep learning algorithms.
